To test whether the generated positions within the sphere of radius $20$ ly, the density of particles in the cross-sectional area of each $x$-value is determined and plotted as a histogram in \figref{fig:UniformlyGeneratedPos} for $100,000$ particles with position generated by the introduced lines of code.  
The density of particles in the cross-sectional area of each $x$-value is found by dividing the total number of particles with that $x$-value with the cross-sectional area of the sphere in that $x$-value (see \figref{Cross_sectional_area}).

\label{fig:Cross_sectional_area}
\end{figure}
The cross-sectional area of the sphere in a specific area is found from a little trigonometry, by first considering that the radius of the circle that makes of the cross-sectional area in a point $x_i$ is given by $r_i = 20sin\theta_i$ ly.  
This yields that the area $A_i$ of the cross-sectional area, in ly, is given as
\begin{align}
	A_i = 400\pi sin^2 \theta_i =  400\pi (1 - cos^2 \theta)
\end{align}
in which the last equal sign stems from $1 = cos^2 \theta + sin^2 \theta$.
But $x_i = 20 cos \theta_i$ ly, giving
\begin{align}
	A_i = \pi (400 - x_i^2)
\end{align}

Histogram of density of 100,000 particles with position generated by the code introduced in \fxnote{where??} as a function of the $x$-coordinate of the particles. The histogram is made with bins in the interval [$-19.5;19.5$] and a bin-size of $0.5$. The distance $x = \pm 20$ from the cluster center is not considered, since the cross-sectional area in that point is zero.
