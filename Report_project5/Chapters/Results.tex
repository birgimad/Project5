The starting point is solving the two body system, where Earth- and Sun-like forms the two bodies with masses $1\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ and $3\cdot 10^{-6} \textrm{M}_{\odot}$, respectively, for which $\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ is the solar mass. 
With the help of the Runge-Kutta method and the Velocity-Verlet method introduced in \secref{Newton2body3D}, the problem is solved both with a stationary Sun-like body relative to the frame of reference, and with both Earth and Sun moving relative to the coordinate system, with an initial velocity (0,0,0) and initial position an (1,1,1) for the Sun. 
For earth the initial position is assigned to be (2,1,1) and initial velocity (0,0.017,0). 

For an $N$ body system, the movement of the bodies with the evolution of time is estimated with the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. 
From the results and analysis the behaviour of the system is unfold.

The results from running the codes described in \chapref{chap:method} for simulating a two-body problem and a star cluster consisting of $N$ particles interacting with the Newtonian force can be found in the GitHub folder  \url{https://github.com/birgimad/Project5_BM_MI_SC}, together with data for various runs of the algorithms and functions.
