Skriv her into til section om RK4 and Verlet method to solving 2 body problem in 3 D.

$\v{r}(t)$ is the three-dimensional space vector consisting of the coordinated $(x(t),y(t),z(t))$, whilst $\v{v}(t)$ is the three-dimensional velocity vector with coordinates $(v_x(t),v_y(t),v_z(t))$, both of which are dependent on time.
