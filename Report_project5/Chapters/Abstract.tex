\chapter*{Abstract}

In this project an open cluster is simulated using two different algorithms, the fourth order Runge-Kutta and the Velocity Verlet. During the project the fourth order Runge-Kutta is chosen as the main algorithm, as it gives more stable results for a many body system. The evolution of the cluster is studied looking at the energies, the distribution of particles and positions as time progresses. Studying the energies it was found that the system lost energy as particles were ejected from the cluster. When the system reached an approximately equilibrium state after a period of $3\tau_{crunch}$, it was consistent with the virial theorem.
