\chapter{Method}
\label{chap:method} 
The methods introduced in this chapter, are used to study the evolution of bodies, also referred to as particles, in the solar system or in the galaxy. 
Firstly, the fourth order Runge-Kutta method and the Velocity-Verlet method are introduced for a 2-body problem in 3 dimensions, however, since the aim of this project is to investigate the time evolution of a star cluster consisting of $N$ particles, the code is extended to $N$ bodies by incorporating suitable changes. 

To generate the $N$ bodies, a function for generating the position coordinates of the N bodies as uniformly distributed particles within a sphere is introduced as discussed in sec \secref{Method:GeneratingPosMassVel}, along with a function for generating masses that are randomly distributed by a Gaussian distribution around ten solar masses with a standard deviation of one solar mass.
